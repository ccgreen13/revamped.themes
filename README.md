##Confluence Revamp theme for Kodi

This is a theme for the default skin confluence for Kodi.
The idea behind this theme is to update some images to improve the overall "feel" to and fix pixelated images, precision issues (half pixels), color matching, elements alignments/centering and sizing.
It was originally intended to be a full replacement for the default textures, but as it happens it turned up it was simpler to make it a theme.

I would be honoured and extremely thankful if you decided to submit PR back for the improvements and changes you make or new PSD's you make yourself.

#### Notes
Nothing is overwritten in the default skin. This is fully and immediately reversible should you not like the changes.
For systems like android/similar you will need to have a way to write to system folders. i.e. root
